PgHelper
=============

Because sometimes I don't want ActiveRecord to parse all fields, nor think about connection.
All features are actually provided by [Pg gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/pg)


Features
-------

* Small
* Ability to pass query params to PostgreSql
* No parsing of strings
* also works as rails plugin `rails plugin install https://github.com/webervin/pg_helper.git`
